# pythonPractice
## Introduction
I created this repository to keep track of my progress in Python 3. I've been working my way through free, online practice materials.

I began programming in July of 2024 and jumped right into projects. The advantage is all code I wrote had an immediate use, but the disadvantage is a complete lack of the fundamentals. I am using these exercises to begin learning from the ground up.

The following is a list of where I am drawing practice materials from, which will be organized into subdirectories:
- [Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/) by Al Sweigart
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) by various contributors
