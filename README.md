## Introduction
I created this repository to keep track of my progress in Python 3. I've been working my way through free, online practice materials.

The following is a list of where I am drawing practice materials from, which will be organized into subdirectories:
- [Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/) by Al Sweigart
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) by various contributors
